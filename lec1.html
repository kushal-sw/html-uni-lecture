        <h3>About</h3>
        
        <pre> 
I’m Kushal, a first-year Computer Science student passionate about solving problems through technology.
Instead of just focusing on exams, I enjoy building projects, experimenting with Python, Web Development, and AI, and sharing my learnings along the way.
Beyond AI, I’m deeply curious about Quantum Computing and believe it could shape the next big leap in technology.
My long-term goal is to grow into a skilled software developer, gain real-world experience through internships and hackathons, and eventually create something impactful of my own.
Always curious, always learning.
