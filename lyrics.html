Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah
Man, let's go


Can't nobody pop it like I do (pop it)
Tour and drop like I do (I)
40 in a seven like I do (seven)
'Caine, she sniff, she hachoo (hachoo, let's go)
Still TEC pop when they try you (whoo)
Big toting, nothin' by you (it's lit)
Pristine cut out of the bayou (skit)


That Oyster right on the dial (Oyst')
That marble right on the tile (moist)
That body too great (huh)
That private, didn't I fly you? (Huh)
That whole 'fit, didn't I style you? (Huh)
Took codeine, it's been a while (huh)


I bet she goin' dumbo (dummy)
I bet she goin' dumbo (that bitch a dummy)
I bet she goin' dumbo (whoo)
I bet she goin' dumbo (straight up)
I bet she goin' dumbo
I bet she goin' dumb


Come on, let it fall to the waistline
You get wasted, just don't waste mine
You get wasted, just don't waste mine
You get wasted, just don't waste mine
Confetti, let it fall to your waistline
You get wasted, just don't waste mine
Right, right


Whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoo)
Shawty, she nice, shawty, she love the green, shawty, she like that white
Shawty geek mode, shawty in geek-geek mode, time to go get that flight
Tryna get home, tryna get right back home, know they gon' get me hype (hype, hype)
Yeah, yeah, gotta sleep with one eye open
Can't trust her, she stolen, but I'm already in too much motion
That bitch tryna get her a promotion, twist my gas, pour my potion
Can't tell if I'm hot or cold, hip on fire, wrist on frozen


Don't know if she thick or slim, waist go in, ass explodin'
I just went up again, just popped ten, no ibuprofen
Back-to-back skin on skin, can I swim in this ocean?
That come down no emotion, yeah, yeah
See, the whip ain't no regular body, the whip got a kit like BBL
One digit on back of the truck and she's backin' it up, no CDL


She with us, I say, "Who do you love?" And she tired of lust, I know she meant well
See the difference when you on this side, lil' baby, the truth ain't hard to tell
Chain on ice cream, can't melt, your nigga don't like me, oh, well
Ain't no peace prize, Nobel, no more gang-gang, cartel
Promise you it won't go well, shit get sticky, caramel
Say your prayers, farewell, body color of pastel
Come on, let it fall to the waistline
You get wasted, just don't waste mine


You get wasted, just don't waste mine
You get wasted, just don't waste mine (ah)
Can't nobody pop it like I do (pop it)
Tour and drop like I do (ah)
40 in a seven like I do (seven)
'Caine, she sniff, she hachoo (high, hachoo)
Still TEC pop when they try you (whoo)
Big toting, nothin' by you (it's lit)
Pristine cut out of the bayou (skit)
That Oyster right on the dial (oyst')


That marble right on the tile (moist)
That body too great (huh)
That private, didn't I fly you? (Huh)
That whole 'fit, didn't I style you? (Huh)
Took codeine, it's been a while (huh)


I bet she goin' dumbo (dummy)
I bet she goin' dumbo (that bitch a dummy)
I bet she goin' dumbo (whoo)
I bet she goin' dumbo (straight up)
I bet she goin' dumbo
I bet she goin' dumb
Oyst'
